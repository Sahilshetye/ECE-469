The project was carried out using  ATALANTA Simulator. The Benchfile and fault list obtained from ATALANTA was  parsed by using Visual Studio and C# as the language. The parsing was carried out using REGEX expressions. 

Instruction:
The Project folder contains the source code as well as .exe excutables.
Since the aim of the project was not  optimization and just ddevelopment of the algorithm. The code was hard coded to  suit my requirements this  code should be just used to understand the  the working. due to it br=eiing hard coded. It will probably not work. Even the efficiency of the code has been kept as it is so that algorithmic apporach could have been thought upoun.

The Bench file are in the ATALANTA folder with .bench as their data type.  The project report is attached on the root direcctory.
